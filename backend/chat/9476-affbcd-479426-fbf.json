It reveals a bizarre reality where particles can exist in multiple places at once (superposition), become instantaneously linked regardless of distance (entanglement), and act as both waves and particles simultaneously, dictating how everything from light bulbs to lasers, and even our own bodies, ultimately function.?</p>"
